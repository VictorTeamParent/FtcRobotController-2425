Road Runner tunning summary

/****************************************************/

 * MaxVelocityTuner
 will run at max speed for the specified RUNTIME  By default, the bot will run full speed for 2 seconds. 
 
 * DriveVelocityPIDTuner 
 The bot will travel travel back and forth in a straight(ish) line over and over, default distance is 72 inches
 
 
 * Follower PID Tuning
 
 HEADING_PID and TRANSLATION_PID. Both options are located in the SampleMecanumDrive file.
 Open up HEADING_PID first. Just keep increasing kP until the robot starts to keep an accurate heading. 
 
 
* straigt Test
GEAR_RATIO in DriveConstants.java :    if measured distance didn't match modify Gear_RATIo
LATERAL_MULTIPLIER variable in SampleMecanumDrive.java:    if straft distance didn't match
MAX_ANG_VEL field in your DriveConstants.java:    run Turn Test to make sure the robot turn 90 degrees 
MAX_ANG_ACCEL field in your DriveConstants.java:   run Turn Test to make sure the robot turn 90 degrees

DriveConstants.java file under TRACK_WIDTH:  

TrackWidthTunerTo tune the track width manually, simply keep adjusting the track width yourself until it turns 180 degrees.
 If the the bot turns less than 180 degrees, raise the trackwidth. 
 If the bot turns more than 180 degrees, lower the trackwidth.
 
 This will turn robot 180 5 times
 
 
 * motor encoder test
 We developed a class call Auto_Encoder_Test and Auto_Encoder_Test to make sure all motors under encoder are running well.
